# CramerClassification
Cramer classification is a series of yes/no questions and is used as a rough guide to how dangerous a chemical is to humans if we eat them. The output of the workflow gives a category for every compound corresponding to how likely they are to be toxic - 1 for low risk, 2 moderate, or 3 high risk.
